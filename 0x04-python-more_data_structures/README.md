## 0x04-python-more_data_structures

Readme for python more data structures. Tasks are done to illustrate the use of the concept.

## About

It is expected that at the end of this section you get a grasp of;
- What are sets and how to use them
- Most common methods of set and how to use them
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files to be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable

## Task | Description
------- | -----------
**`0-square_matrix_simple.py`** | Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
**`2-uniq_add.py`** | Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
**`3-common_elements.py`** | Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
**`4-only_diff_elements.py`** | Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
**`5-number_keys.py`** | Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
**`6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`** | Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
**`7-update_dictionary.py`** | Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
**`8-simple_delete.py`** | Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
**`9-multiply_by_2.py`** | Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
**`10-best_score.py`** | Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
**`11-multiply_list_map.py`** | Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
**`12-roman_to_int.py`** | Create a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) to an integer.
**`100-weight_average.py`** | Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
**`101-square_matrix_map.py`** | Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using `map`
**`102-complex_delete.py`** | Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
**`103-python.c`** | Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
